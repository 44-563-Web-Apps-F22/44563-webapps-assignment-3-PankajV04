    <h3>Fun Facts about the Mascot</h3>
    <p>
        Proud, strong, and courageous, every UAFS student feels a connection to Numa. Named after the lion in Edgar Rice Burroughs’ "Tarzan of the Apes," Numa  has long been a fixture at UAFS.
    </br>These books were extremely popular during the 1920s, the same time Fort Smith Junior College was being formed. 

A statue depicting the live-action Numa sits in front of the Stubblefield Center, home of the Lions basketball and volleyball teams. </br>
The 15-foot statue was unveiled on April 28, 2010, and is the largest statue of a leaping lion in the world.
