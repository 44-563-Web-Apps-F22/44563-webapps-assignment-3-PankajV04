        <h1>Pankaj Sanjay Vishwakarma</h1>
        <h5>Salar Jung Museum</h5>
        <p> The museum has a famous <b>Quran collection</b>, from around the world in different fonts and designs, called the 
            Quran Written with Gold and Silver. </br>There are many more collections of <b>religious books</b>, as well as Arabic Quran.

            I liked the room with the statues the best of all. There was a statue of the <b>Veiled Rebecca.</b> </br>
            It was so beautiful that I felt I could reach out and lift her veil myself. Then there were huge paintings on display.
        </br>The colours still looked very fresh. There were many pieces of <b>Japanese embroidering</b> at how much skill had gone into making them.
